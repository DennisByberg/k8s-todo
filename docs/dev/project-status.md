## Current Status

**Environment:** AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)  
**Nodes:** 2x Standard_B2s (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)  
**Replicas:** 1x Backend, 1x Frontend, 1x Postgres  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (build images on push to main)  
**GitOps:** ArgoCD (auto-sync from main branch)  
**Cost:** ~$65/month (destroy with `terraform destroy` when not in use)

---

## Next Priority

**Networking & Ingress** - Public URL with NGINX Ingress Controller and SSL/TLS
