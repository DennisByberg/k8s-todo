## Current Status

**Environment:** AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)  
**Nodes:** 2x Standard_B2s (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)  
**Replicas:** 2x Backend, 2x Frontend, 1x Postgres  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (build images on push to main)  
**GitOps:** ArgoCD (auto-sync from main branch)  
**Ingress:** NGINX Ingress Controller (Public IP: 4.165.9.111)  
**Public Access:** http://4.165.9.111 (Frontend), http://4.165.9.111/api/docs (Backend API)  
**Cost:** ~$87/month (~$22 for Load Balancer + IP, destroy with `terraform destroy` when not in use)

## Next Priority

**SSL/TLS Certificates** - Setup HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
