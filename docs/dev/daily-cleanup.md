Quick commands to cleanup after a day's work.

## üßπ Local Development

### Stop Application

```bash
# Switch to local context
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

# Uninstall Helm release
helm uninstall todo-app -n todo-app

# Delete namespace (removes all resources)
kubectl delete namespace todo-app

# Verify everything is gone
kubectl get all -n todo-app
```

**Note:** If namespace is stuck in "Terminating":

```bash
kubectl delete namespace todo-app --force --grace-period=0
```

### Stop Docker Desktop

You can now quit Docker Desktop to free up system resources.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure (AKS)

### Option 1: Keep Running (~$65/month)

If you're actively working on the project:

```bash
# Just close your terminals
# AKS keeps running, data persists
```

**Pros:**

- Instant startup tomorrow
- All data persists
- No re-deployment needed

**Cons:**

- Costs ~$65/month even when idle

### Option 2: Destroy Infrastructure (Recommended)

If you won't work on this for a while:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform

# Review what will be deleted
terraform plan -destroy

# Destroy all Azure resources
terraform destroy
```

Type `yes` to confirm. This takes ~5 minutes.

**Pros:**

- No ongoing costs
- Clean slate

**Cons:**

- Takes 5-10 min to recreate tomorrow
- All data is lost (database, persistent volumes)
- Must rebuild and push images again
